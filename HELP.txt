Instructions for using the Friendly Virtual Radio Interferometer.
_______________________________________________________________________________

1) Select an array configuration by clicking the table on the right. The layout of the antennas will be shown in the plot.
2) Use the slider to set the hour angle range to observe for this array.
3) Click the 'Add' button to add the chosen array configuration and hour angle range to the observation linup.
4) Repeat steps (1) to (3) to accumulate further arrays and hour angles.
5) Set the observing frequency, Declination of the source and sampling cadence (clock time).
6) Click on the folder icon to browse for a model image. Valid image formats include PNG, JPEG and GIF.
7) Set an image pixel scale to specify the size of your model image.
8) Run the observation by clicking on the 'Do Observation' button. The results (model FFT, uv-coverage, gridded FFT, synthesised beam image and observed image will be plotted in the Display Window.
